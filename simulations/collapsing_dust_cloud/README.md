# Abstractioness

**A minimal informational universe simulation and theoretical framework**

---

## Overview

Abstractioness is a research project and simulation exploring the deep nature of reality as an emergent phenomenon from abstract information. Inspired by information theory, general relativity, and consciousness studies, it models a universe unfolding from a low-entropy initial state, simulating particle dynamics near singularities and extracting entropy-based signatures.

The ultimate goal is to provide computational experiments and theoretical insights into how spacetime, gravity, and consciousness may arise from pure information, supporting a unifying abstract theory of everything.

## Features

- Generates dust clouds with configurable particle counts and masses
- Simulates particle trajectories with gravity-inspired dynamics (GR-like acceleration)
- Visualizes gravitational potential as 2D color gradients
- Renders 3D particle clouds
- Extracts bitstring sequences near singularities to visualize entropy dynamics
- Produces animations combining all visualizations for analysis
