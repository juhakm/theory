## Overview

This project simulates how an **observer**, represented as a 2D binary pattern, finds itself embedded in 
a universe described by **finite information**. Our goal is to find the most likely configuration of 
reality from the observer's point of view — an idea central to a fully **information-theoretic Theory of Everything**.

Finite **Fourier components** is used for compressing data - to increase the number of observers a spacetime can embed. 
This naturally lead to  quantum-like probability interpretations of observer presence via wavefunction overlap.

Note: in the spirit of the theory, we should construct all the possibles universes, and all the possible observers, to find 
the best matches. For performance reasons, this settle to study one observer only.



## Technical Insight: Compression, Fourier, and Bayesian Filtering

- **Observer**: A predefined binary matrix (e.g., a circle) representing a structure in spacetime.
- **Universe**: A 2D spacetime information field constructed using a limited set of sine/cosine waves (compressed Fourier basis).
- **Similarity Matching** correlation of observer pattern with continuous field — interpreted as a **probability amplitude**.
- **Selection**: From multiple generated universes, the simulation selects the one where the observer appears most clearly.

### Compression and Probability

- Compression is equivalent to probability: more compressible states are more likely under an algorithmic prior (Solomonoff).
- Fourier modes serve as a natural basis for compressible spacetimes.
- Limiting to a sparse Fourier spectrum implies we are only sampling from the most probable universes.

### Bayesian Filtering Analogy

This simulation acts like a **Bayesian filter**:

- **Hypothesis space** = All possible spacetime bitstrings
- **Prior** = Simpler (more compressible) bitstrings are more likely (Fourier-limited)
- **Likelihood** = Observer pattern matches (how often the observer appears)
- **Posterior** ∝ Prior × Likelihood → Highest when a compressible spacetime contains a dense observer


## Output

Four plots demonstrating the wave evolution of the observer with heatmaps. Observers are
marked in the spacetime as overlay rectangles. The plots demonstrates:

- **Wavefunctions** emerging naturally from high-compression bitstring universes.
- **Interference** arising as the detection mechanism for observer motifs.
- **Physics**  as a filtering process where informational constraints select for structured realities.

From this perspective, quantum behavior, continuity, and even time are statistical artifacts of optimal observer embedding in compressible informational structures.


## Future Work

- Generalize to 4D spacetime for 3D geometric shapes, and allow animated 3D observers to be modeled using 3D software
- Show how General Relativty arises from the Theory, for complete theory of everything
- Evaluate entropy gradients and emergent fields.
