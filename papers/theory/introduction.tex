\section{Introduction}

Physics has long grappled with the apparent disjunction between quantum mechanics and general relativity. While the former describes the probabilistic behavior of subatomic particles, the latter governs the smooth, deterministic curvature of spacetime. Unifying these frameworks has proven notoriously difficult, particularly due to the fundamentally different assumptions about locality, determinism, and measurement.

As intelligent observers embedded in the universe, we attempt to model the very system we are part of. This raises foundational limits reminiscent of Gödel's incompleteness theorem: just as no sufficiently powerful formal system can prove all truths about itself, perhaps no internal observer can derive a complete physical theory of the universe from within \cite{dyson2004godel}. These self-referential limits motivate the search for a new foundation grounded not in geometry or fields, but in information.

In this work, we reject the presumption that spacetime or particles are ontologically fundamental \cite{wheeler1990it} \citation{zuse1970calculating}. We show that the universe is made of abstract information, provided only four observable assumptions hold. Spacetime and particles must then be emergent properties arising from information \cite{zuse1970calculating} \cite{tegmark2008mathematical}. Our goal is to develop a framework in which everything we perceive—including geometry, matter, time, and even consciousness—can be derived from information.

\section{Four Informational Assumptions}

We begin with four assumptions that are observationally and logically plausible. From these assumptions, we derive a powerful conclusion: the universe must be fundamentally informational in nature \cite{tegmark2008mathematical} \cite{wheeler1990it}, and all possible informational states already exist.

By developing this line of reasoning, we will reinterpret major physical concepts as informational phenomena and resolve long-standing paradoxes such as:

\begin{itemize}
      \item The nature of time and its arrow.
      \item Physics governing black hole singularities.
      \item The emergence of spacetime from discrete informational states.
      \item A minimal model of the universe with physical laws as emergent properties.
\end{itemize}

Each of these topics will be demonstrated and backed by mathematical models and simulations written in Python.

The framework offers a minimal, computable, and logically consistent foundation for physics. It assumes no physical predefined substrates besides information. The existence of observers, measurement, gravity, and time is expressed within a single unifying theory.

What follows is not speculation, but deduction. If the four initial axioms hold, the universe must be an abstract informational object.
