# Theory

Welcome to **Theory**, a research and simulation project exploring a novel information-theoretic model of reality. This repository hosts the source code, simulations, and papers developing the *Theory* — a framework proposing that the universe emerges from pure abstract information with no predefined subtrace.

---

## Project Overview

The core idea behind *Theory* is that physical reality, including spacetime and consciousness, can be understood as emergent phenomena arising from abstract, discrete information. 
The project combines formal mathematical theory, simulation experiments, and computational visualizations to investigate these concepts.

Key components include:

- **LaTeX Papers:** Rigorous formulations, proofs, and theoretical discussions outlining the foundational assumptions and implications.
- **Simulations:** Programs simulating dust clouds, gravitational dynamics, entropy evolution, and observer-centric processes.
- **Data & Visualizations:** Outputs such as animations, entropy maps, and geometric renderings illustrating theoretical predictions.
