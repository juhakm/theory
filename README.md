# The Abstract Universe Project

Welcome to **The Abstract Universe Project**, a research and simulation project exploring a novel information-theoretic model of reality. 
This repository hosts the source code, simulations, and papers developing the *The Abstract Universe Project* — a framework proposing that the 
universe emerges from pure abstract information with no predefined subtrace.

---

## Project Overview

The project combines formal mathematical theory, simulation experiments, and computational visualizations to investigate these concepts.

Key components include:

- **LaTeX Papers:** Rigorous formulations, proofs, and theoretical discussions outlining the foundational assumptions and implications.
- **Simulations:** Programs simulating dust clouds, gravitational dynamics, entropy evolution, and observer-centric processes.
- **Data & Visualizations:** Outputs such as animations, entropy maps, and geometric renderings illustrating theoretical predictions.
