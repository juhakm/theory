# Abstractioness

Welcome to **Abstractioness**, a research and simulation project exploring a novel information-theoretic model of reality. This repository hosts the source code, simulations, and papers developing the *Real Theory of Everything* — a framework proposing that the universe emerges as an abstract informational structure from foundational axioms and entropy dynamics. 

---

## Project Overview

The core idea behind *Abstractioness* is that physical reality, including spacetime and consciousness, can be understood as emergent phenomena arising from abstract, discrete information systems. The project combines formal mathematical theory, simulation experiments, and computational visualizations to investigate these concepts.

Key components include:

- **LaTeX Papers:** Rigorous formulations, proofs, and theoretical discussions outlining the foundational assumptions and implications.
- **Simulations:** Python-based programs simulating dust clouds, gravitational dynamics, entropy evolution, and observer-centric processes.
- **Data & Visualizations:** Outputs such as animations, entropy maps, and geometric renderings illustrating theoretical predictions.
